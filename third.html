    <h1>Why to Learn java Programming?</h1>
   </header>
   <p title="">Java is a MUST for students and working professionals to become
     a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Software Development 
     Domain. I will list down some of the
     key advantages of learning Java Programming:
   </p>

    <dl>
      <dt class="reasons">Object-Oriented </dt>
      <dd class="description01">In Java,everything is an Object.Java can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl> 
      <dt class="reasons">Platform Independent</dt>
      <dd>unlike many other programming languages including c and c++, when
         java is complied,It is not complited into platform specific machine,
         rather into platform independent byte code.This byte code is distributed
        over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine(JVM) on whichever
         platform it is being run on.</dd>
      </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt class="reasons">Simple</dt>
      <dd>
        Java is designed to be easy to learn.if you understand the basic concept of 
        <em>OOP java</em>,it would be easy to master.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt class="reasons">Secure</dt>
      <dd>With Java's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free tamper-free 
        systems. Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.</dd>
    </div>

    <dl>
      <dt class="reasons">Architecture-neutral</dt>
      <dd>Java complier generates an architecture-neutral object file format, which 
        makes the complied code executable on many processors,with the presence of Java
        runtime system.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt class="reasons">Portable</dt>
      <dd>Being architecture-neutral and having no implementation dependent
         aspect's of the specification makes Java Portable.<em>Compiler in Java is written in ANSI C </em>
        with a clean portability boundary, which is a POSIX subset.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt class="reasons">Robust<dt>
      <dd class="description07">Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone situations by
         emphrasing mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking.</dd>
    </dl>
